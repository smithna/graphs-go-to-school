# Marshmallow Graphs

Give students (or groups of students with an adult volunteer) marshmallows and toothpicks. Show them how they can connect the marshmallows with the toothpicks to make a graph.

Work with students to answer these questions about their marshmallow graph.

* How many edges does each node in your graph have? Make a table to show your answer.
* How many triangles are in your graph? 
* Which edge is part of the most triangles? 
* Which edges could you remove to separate your graph into multiple parts?
