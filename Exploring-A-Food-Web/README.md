# Exploring a Food Web

Adults work with students in small groups to explore a food web represented in a graph database. The groups could use laptops provided by KC Graph Database Meetup or school computers using a free website. Groups could use the graph to answer questions like “If a member of the food web disappeared, what plants and animals would be most impacted?” Groups can add new plants or animals to the graph based on their prior knowledge or research during the workshop.
