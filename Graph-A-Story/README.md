# Graph a Story

Adult volunteers will demonstrate a graph showing how characters in a book are related to each other. Groups of students will work with an adult volunteer to create a graph based on a book or movie that they are familiar with. Nodes in the graph can represent characters, settings, and events in the plot. Relationships will show how nodes are connected. Groups of students will create their graphs with pencil and paper. If time permits, the adult will help students enter their graph into a graph database.

We need child-friendly examples here. Les Miserables and Game of Thrones don't fit the bill. Is there an open source Harry Potter graph?
