# The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg

This workshop topic is based on the lesson plan at https://www.mathsisfun.com/activity/seven-bridges-konigsberg.html

Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician who invented graph theory in the 1700s. He started thinking about graphs when he visited the city of Konigsberg. There were seven bridges that crossed the rivers of the city. He wondered if he could take a walk around Konigsberg that would cross each of the bridges exactly once. Adults will work with small groups of students to try to draw their own paths on a map of Konigsberg. Groups will also try finding paths through other simple maps and see what patterns we notice.
