Workshop ideas to teach kids about network graphs

Adult professionals with graph database skills (e.g. [The Kansas City Graphs Databases Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Kansas-City-Graph-Databases-Meetup-Group/)) can partner with schools or other youth organizations to put on workshops to teach concepts of graph theory and graph databases for children and youth. Adapt ideas here, and please share new ones and your feedback about what was successful.

[Graph Databases Educational Workshop Proposal](https://github.com/smithna/graphs-go-to-school/blob/master/Graph%20Databases%20Educational%20Workshop%20Proposal.docx) is a sample document that you can share with schools or youth organizations to explain the idea of the workshop.
